# Ok, let's start by deleting everything but Java, and the messages.txt files
make clean
# Let's compile Dsa.java and Tester.java
# Dsa.java is my library
# Tester.java is just some code to excercise it
make 
# Let's show just the command line options and how to properly run the program (CLASSPATH, etc.)
make help

make genkeys
# Now let's run it and create a signature, a private key, and a public key
make run
# Now let's use the signature and the public key to verify the message.
make verify
# Now let's change the message and see if the the signature still verifies.
# This would also fail, if we changed the public key or the signature.
make fail
# Let's show the security functions supported by this version of Java
#make security
